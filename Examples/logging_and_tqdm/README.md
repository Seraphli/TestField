# Example about logging and tqdm

This is a simple example of using this two modules.
Logging is colored with custom configuration.
And the example can run properly on Pycharm.

## Hint

If you using logging and tqdm in Pycharm,
you will find your logging and tqdm output
rendered in red with default configuration.

This problem is also described [here][1],
which can be resolved by defining sys.stdout as their output stream.
